    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners.

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "1) **Gaussian Naive Bayes:** <br>\n",
    "- Real World Application: Email SPam Classifier <br>\n",
    "- Strengths of the model: Performs well on sparse data (like text data) and has a fast training/predicting time. ALways a good baseline model. <br>\n",
    "- Weakness: The accuracy of Naive Bayes is not that good as compared to linear models. <br>\n",
    "- Why a good candidate: Given our dataset is also sparse text data with high dimensionality, GaussianNB comes as a good candidate. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **RandomForestClassifier** <br>\n",
    "- Real World Application: Almost all predictive models use some kind of Ensemble Learning at the end to increase the predicting power of the base (weak) learners.\n",
    "- Strengths of the model: Avoids overfitting, and always better than their weak learner,i.e decision trees.\n",
    "- Weakness: Sometimes can be computationally heavy on the cores of the PC.\n",
    "- Why a good candidate: Being a high dimensional data, a single deicison tree would have been hard to train and would overfit. Therefore, we go with its Ensemble.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**\n",
    "- Real World Application: Use of SVMs provides better search accuracy for image classification. It provides better accuracy in comparison to the traditional query-based searching techniques.\n",
    "- Strengths of the model: The SVM provides a kernel support for the data that cannot be linearly seperated\n",
    "- Weakness: Training the data can take a lot of time )specially in high dimensional or large dataset)\n",
    "- Why a good candidate: SVM works well with high dimensional data with quite high accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The metrics (F-score) on 100% of the data is found to be highest for both - the training and the testing sets used for our evaluation among the three models. \n",
    "- Though the training score for Random Forest Classifier is quite high than both GaussianNB and SVM, in the testing scores, there are almost equal scores for Random Forest and SVM. So, here the **training time** comes into play. We observe, that the training time for SVM model is very high compared to the other two. Even while running the train command above, I found that while it just took few seconds for the two models to train 100% of data, it took about 3-4 minutes for SVM to train on 100% of data.\n",
    "- Random Forest Classifier is suitable for our data as not only it gives better scores in our given model evaluation but it also is an Ensemble method for Decision tree, which performs quite beter in terms of generalizing the data (not overfit). Also, it performs quite good if the number of features are high (e.g 103 in our case)"

    "**Answer:** <br>\n",
    "Random Forest Classifier is a Supervised Learning algorithm that literally creates forest! The forest is a combination of various trees known as Decion trees.Finally, it merges the score obtained from the different tress to get an overall better prediction. So, what is a decison tree? <br>\n",
    "A Decision Tree is like making our daily life decicions. e.g If it is raining outside, then take an umbrella. If it's not raining but cold outside then take your coat but if it's hot, take your shades. Basically we **split** our decisions into two subcategories and further split those into next subcategories Basically, we try to create a tree of our Decisions! <br>\n",
    "So, we know what are Decision trees. But what if we create a tree of very high depth? e.g If a person is male, has a dog, lives alone and goes for a walk in the evening, is more than 6 feet and has a beard then it is likely that he will install \"Instagram\". This is overfitting. Where we have considered way too many features and instead of trying to focus on generalized results, we memorize the data. <br>\n",
    "This is where Random Forest comes in. What is does is, that instead of considering all data at a time, it creates subsets of data (with replacement). Then a simpler (weak) decision tree (e.g with just maximum depth = 2) is trained for all these subsets. Finally, the scores are accumulated to give a much more better refined score."

Here, age is found to have one of the highest feature weights which is true (experience comes with age). The hours-per-week feature was something that actually is a determing factor as person generally demands a salary on hours per week. Though, I am quite surprised by how Marital status also played an important feature! Otherwise, all features seem to be relevant for prediction."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
